## About Me

**I love to engage deeply with different perspectives.** I grew up attending 13 different schools and moved at least once every 3 years across Japan, Korea, and the US. I design philosophy workshops for Corrupt the Youth, an outreach program for high schoolers lacking access to philosophy to gain tools for developing their viewpoints. I am an incoming Writing Center Fellow at Pomona College, where I will have the privilege to learn from my classmates’ ideas, and continue my lifelong habit of interviewing people.  

**The theme of technology is my entryway for thinking about gross inequality in the world.** Starting July 2020 I attended the Summer Institute at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society with 23 graduate and undergraduate students. I also designed an interactive workshop for Free Radicals critiquing techno-solutionism from a historical point of view. I am the director of Claremont Colleges Tech for Good, where we ask whom a certain technology is good for and whether it shifts power.

**I value working with, and listening to, the people whom I serve from a place of intellectual and cultural humility.** In the wake of COVID-19, I worked closely with impacted students and facilitated a grassroots effort that raised $170,000 in total towards a mutual aid fund for displaced classmates at Pomona College. I also served on the Board of Directors of an international nonprofit that supports 25 college organizations examining technology and social justice, where my role was to shape strategy according to voices of student leaders.

**I have evolved since my former life looking for purely technological solutions for social problems.** I am a US first-place winner of the 2015 Technovation Challenge, and Japanese first-place winner of the 2012 National Teen App Awards. I once created an iPhone app downloaded by 120,000 people to engage in public speaking with more confidence. I also spoke at company events such as Google, Apple, and Microsoft, most often for promoting the documentary CodeGirl, which I appeared in for creating an app where high school students could exchange compliments and resist a hypercompetitive culture. 

**I pay it forward.** I consider myself incredibly lucky to be supported by the Son Masayoshi Foundation, the Yanai Tadashi Foundation, and countless friends and teachers with whom I found footing after experiencing domestic violence and housing / financial insecurity. “Not for self,” the motto of my boarding high school Phillips Academy Andover, is held closely to my heart. I am a California state-certified Domestic Violence Advocate.

I just finished my junior year at Pomona College, where I study Mathematics and Philosophy. I began my college career at a quirky STEM college, Harvey Mudd, but transferred to an institution next door to study the social systems in and out of STEM. 

Now that you know me better, please call me Mo-ay! In the future, I look forward to working with local grassroots organizations, examining my position on global capitalism, and learning how to apply rigorous and quantitative tools to dismantle social injustice. 

## Past Work

### Power not Paranoia: Online Safety for Student Activists

In the midst of the largest political movement in U.S. History, and the unfolding of the global COVID-19 pandemic, student organizers have risen up to support and protect their communities through campaigns such as #40BillionForWhat (Harvard) and a $170,000 mutual aid fund (Pomona). Many of these students have been displaced from their college campuses in the wake of the pandemic and organize mostly online, presenting promises as well as perils of making oneself visible online and collecting data through their activities. In this project, three undergraduate college students — some of us organizers ourselves — interviewed 10 college students and 3 legal experts to put together an accessible resource for college students to gain awareness of factors affecting their online safety. Our guide aims to address differential levels of online safety across factors such as race, citizenship, and gender, clarifies existing legal frameworks around online safety, and introduces community-based strategies for protecting one another. We intend for the guide to be a starting point for college community members to acknowledge and reconceptualize the notion of online safety as an integral part of mobilizing students and building community-based power, and envision this as the first in a series of interventions directed towards students, college administrations, and campus organizations.
